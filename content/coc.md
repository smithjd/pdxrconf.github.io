## Code of Conduct

CascadiaConf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately or email `cascadiarconf@gmail.com`. Conference staff can be identified by special badges.

### Photography Policy
At the conference all attendees and speakers will be wearing a sticker in one of three colors.
Green for "it is okay to photograph me without asking" yellow for "ask for permission to photograph me" and red for "do not photograph me".

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect attendees, sponsors, volunteers, and speakers to adhere to the code of conduct during the conference, conference events at off-site locations, in related online communities and social media. We will be monitoring all social media related to the conference throughout the year.
If you have any questions, email `cascadiarconf@gmail.com`
